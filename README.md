### Notes

 * The data for training and testing is generated by `dat/GenerateClassesData.m`. Both data in two classes is normally distributed.
 * The data is two-dimensional.
 * The data is divided into two classes as an example.
 * Edit `enum DatType` in `dat.h` to modify the names and quantities of the classes.
 * The arguments for `int main(int argc, char** argv)` are:
