### Notes
 * The data is two-dimensional.
 * The data is divided into three classes as an example.
 * All the data is normally distributed.
 * For `dat/train.txt` and `dat/test.txt`, the ranges of data are coincident partly, and the data is generated by `dat/GenerateClasses.m`.
 * For `dat/train-seperated.txt` and `dat/test-seperated.txt`, the ranges of data are seperated totally, and the data is generated by `dat/GenerateSeperatedClasses.m`.
 * You can also modify the parameters in `*.m` codes to generate other data.
 * The arguments for `int main(int argc, char** argv)` are:
```cpp
basic-surpervised-classifications.exe dat/train.txt dat/test.txt dat/train-seperated.txt dat/test-seperated.txt
```

#### Fisher's linear discriminant
 * The data for training is in `dat/train.txt`, and for testing, in `dat/test.txt`.
 * If you want to modify the names and quantities of the classes, besides modifying `dat/*.txt`, you should:
 * Modify `enum Fisher::DatType` in `Fisher/Fisher-dat.h`;
 * Modify the characters for recognizing types in `void Fisher::ReadDat(...)` in `Fisher/Fisher-dat.cpp` according to the format of `dat/*.txt`;
 * Modify `color` in `pic.h` accordingly.

#### Perceptron approach
 * The data for training is in `dat/train-seperated.txt`, and for testing, in `dat/test-seperated.txt`.
