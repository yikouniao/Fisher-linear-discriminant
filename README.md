### Notes
 * The data is two-dimensional.
 * The data is divided into three classes as an example.
 * The arguments for `int main(int argc, char** argv)` are:
```cpp
basic-surpervised-classifications.exe dat/train.txt dat/test.txt dat/train-seperated.txt dat/test-seperated.txt
```

#### Fisher's linear discriminant
 * The data for training `dat/train.txt` and testing `dat/test.txt` is generated by `dat/GenerateClasses.m`. All data in three patterns is normally distributed.
 * Edit `enum FisherDatType` in `Fisher/dat.h` to modify the names and quantities of the classes.

#### Perceptron approach
 * The data for training `dat/train-seperated.txt` and testing `dat/test-seperated.txt` is generated by `dat/GenerateSeperatedClasses.m`. All data in three patterns is normally distributed.
